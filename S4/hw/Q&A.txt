1. What are the main functional differences between a while and a for?
2. What’s the difference between break and continue?
3. When is a loop’s else clause executed?
4. How can you code a counter-based loop in Python?
5. What can a range be used for in a for loop?



1. The while statement, provides a way to code general loops.
The for statement, is designed for stepping through the items in a sequence or
other iterable object and running a block of code for each.

2.
break:
  Jumps out of the closest enclosing loop (past the entire loop statement)
continue:
  Jumps to the top of the closest enclosing loop (to the loop’s header line)

3. Runs if and only if the loop is exited normally (i.e., without hitting a break)

4. use 'enumerate'

5.  range generates a list of integers from zero up to but not including
the argument’s value.
