ex: 
+, 4 == 2+2 => True
+, 5 - 1 != 6 - 2 => False
+, 8 % 2 !=  => False

2. What is a flow chart? Draw flow chart for the following code snippet: (you can draw on a paper, take a picture of it)

=> it is a type of diagram that represents the flow of execution of the program

=>Nested conditions comprise condition statements contained within the definition of other condition statements.
